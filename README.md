# AI system assignment ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£
This was written using basic python to deeply understand the forward and backward propagation of a neural network.



Assign. 1

- Download the Simple CNN model which was reviewed during the last lecture 
by Shoaib Sajid.
- Study the pure python code for the MNIST CNN model and run the pre-trained 
model on 5 MNIST test images of your random selection.
- Study a PyTorch version of the same MNIST CNN model and run the pre-trained 
model on the same 5 MNIST test images as the above.
- Plot the 5 tested images and CNNâ€™s prediction results obtained using the two 
CNN codes.
- Write a 3 page report as follows: 
 
* 1st page: Explain the pure python code for the MNIST CNN (include important 
part of the code)
* 2nd page: Explain PyTorch version for the MNIST CNN (include important part 
of the code), 
* 3rd page: Display the 5 images and prediction results.
